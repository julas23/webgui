      <p align="justify">That application can be executed with the necessary privileges to run all the instructions, tools and commands easily and faster, think about that layer like a Documentention as our WIKI, but a lot smarter, that have not only the information about the Tasks, but the opportunity and condition to run it showing the System STDOUT to check if everything is working fine.</p>
      <p align="justify">In specific cases when the usual command do not work, you can use the GET space to input an incremental command with parameters, or better, you can change to a WEBSHELL where you have a TRUE Console Command Line, to work in the server you need.</p>
      <p align="justify">Here is the iframe content, this frame is used basically to receive all information sent by the Operational System redirecting the STDOUT here. The command that will request that STDOUT, must be included in the menu, the frame in left side, and is totally configurable to keep the necessities and most important commands used by the team.</p>
    <p align="justify">Enjoy it!</p>
